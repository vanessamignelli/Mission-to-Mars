# Mission-to-Mars

## Objective
The purpose of this project was to gather information from different areas of the web and consolidate it into one convenient location. The goal was to leverage python and webscraping to be able to navigate webpages and scrape new data to collect information at the press of a button. Data was then stored in an unstructured database in mongoDB and display in an app using Flask.
